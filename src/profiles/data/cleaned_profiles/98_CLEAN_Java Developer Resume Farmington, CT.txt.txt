Developed more user-interactive web pages using AJAX, JavaScript, and AngularJS. Tested functionality and performance of web services via Soap UI. Developed web services wif SOAP. Consumed Web Services for transferring data between different applications. Used JAX-WS SOAP Web services to retrieve credit history of the applicants. Involved in implementing the complete Application in the in-build MVC Architecture wif AngularJS. Used different type of spring controllers depending on the business requirement. Used Spring Core for dependency injection/Inversion of control (IOC), and integrated Spring MVC and Hibernate. Good experience wif Spring MVC, Used Spring MVC to send the request from UI to Controllers. Used Spring IOC all through the application in the Business Layer. Used Spring 3 Annotations across the application.Used Hibernate in the DAO Layer.Performed unit testing using JUnit. Developed different modules of the application using IBM RAD and Eclipse Kepler.

Confidential, Farmington, CT Java Developer Responsibilities: Involved in the SDLC phases of the project to analyze the requirements, design, development and testing of the application based on Java/J2EE technologies and Design Patterns. Designed and developed Application based on Spring MVC Framework using MVC design pattern. Used Spring Core for dependency injection/Inversion of control (IOC) and Hibernate Framework for Persistence onto Oracle Database. Developed dynamic web application using JSF and JSP technologies. Developed the application using Eclipse IDE. Involved in creating the Use cases, Class Diagrams, and Sequence diagrams using UML Developed the application using Struts Framework dat leverages classical Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. Implemented the caching mechanism in Hibernate to load data from Oracle database Designed Use Cases using UML and managed the entire functional requirements life cycle using water fall model. Extensively using core JAVA concepts like Collections Framework, Multi-Threading, OO concepts, Exception handling for developing application modules. Extensive use of Alerts, Navs, Glyph icons, Grids, Panels, Buttons, Media Objects and Progress Bars provided by Twitter Bootstrap framework. Deployed the application in various environments DEV, QA and also Production. Used the JDBC for data retrieval from the database for various inquiries. Created Application Property Files and implemented internationalization. Involved in complete development of ‘Agile Development Methodology’ and tested the application in each iteration. Build RESTful Web services using JAX-RS API. Used Spring Core Annotations for Dependency Injection Spring DI and Spring MVC for REST API s Used spring dependency injection to inject all the required dependency in application. Wrote complex PL/SQL and HQL queries to retrieve data from the Oracle database. E2E Development by integrating Front End and Backend by Debugging. Fixing System testing issues and UAT issues.
