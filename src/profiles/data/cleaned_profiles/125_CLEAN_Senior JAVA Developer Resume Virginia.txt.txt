Implemented microservices using play/akka and spring boot, configured play and akka modules, created controllers and actors. Used elastic search wif java to fetch data based on queries, used Redis, Guava for cache mechanism Created various proto serializers to communicate between modules. Used java8 asynchronous programming to make various concurrency calls to business components, used Scala html templates to get HTML content Used Kafka as an order processor, extensively used JAX-B and Gson for data in and out flow. Extensively used Java 8 features like streams, lambda expressions, completable feature, optional, Predicates, Functions to process objects effectively Using Java Script, jQuery, React JS concepts like redux store, controllers, reducers, actions Extensively involved in using Kibana message queue processor to monitor logs and health check of teh application. Extensively implemented API’s using spring boot wif various media types. Used Hibernate to make DB operations like user transactions, Heat Map, Web service logs, Flows, session configurations. Extensively involved in using DOM parser, JAX-B parser, XSLT, X-path to manipulate XML structure. Configured Hibernate second level cache using Ehcache to reduce teh number of hits to teh configuration table data. Implemented generic engine in JAVA for business-driven flows. Wif these engine, business users able to create flow and all teh flow controlling is done through JAVA engine. Environment: Java 8, play/akka, Spring Boot, elastic search, Redis, Guava, proto serialize, Scala HTML, Kafka, JAXB, JSON, Java Script, jQuery, NodeJS, React JS, Spring Rest, Hibernate, Kibana. Confidential, TX JAVA Developer Responsibilities: Migrated legacy loan accounting applications to next generation using open Spring Batch, Spring REST and IBM rules engine Operational Decision Manager (ODM). Contribute to review and analyze of user stories, solution specifications, and architecture and design documents. Implement services using spring framework IOC/JDBC/ORM, AOP and Spring Batch. Configured spring batch partitioning for loan events processing Called ODM business rules APIs engine to validate events data. Implemented asynchronous audit logging framework using AspectJ and processed using Spring Batch to load into file system. Used Dependency Injection feature of Spring framework and Hibernate O/R mapping tool for rapid development and ease of maintenance. Created and consumed web services using Spring 4.0, implemented microservices to get desirable pay load from total payload to reduce network load. Used Spring framework for implementing IOC/JDBC/ORM, AOP. Implemented Transactions using Spring Transaction Management and AOP framework. Extensively used Spring IOC, configured Application Context files and performed database object mapping using Hibernate annotations Implemented Object-relation mapping in teh persistence layer using hibernate framework in conjunction wif spring functionality. Responsible for teh oracle schema design, generating various POJO objects and generating their corresponding Hibernate mappings (.hbm) files. Developed teh DAO layer for teh application using Spring Template support Environment: JEE, Spring, Spring Batch, Spring REST, Spring Boot, Hibernate, LDAP, ECLIPSE, SVN, RESTful, Oracle11g, Maven 3.0.4, JUnit 3.8, XML, WebLogic, UNIX. Confidential Jr. Java Developer Responsibilities: Actively involved in understanding and suggesting proper solutions to teh user requirements wif onsite team. Used Agile PLM as a business tool to configure business objects like Change, Part, Workflow, Item, Events, Supplier and User. Wrote process extensions and Custom Events in java to process and present business objects. Wrote complex queries and PL/SQL procedures to retrieve data from Oracle PLM database and checking on going schedulers and running process in teh system and monitoring their status. Fixing teh issues wif teh scheduled process by decreasing teh running time. Consumed Restful Web Services from SOA team to integrate data between different platforms. Wrote RESTful Web Services and gave contract details. Used XML parser to read data from XML files. Serialized object data to store in files, De-serialized teh saved object from files to read them back. Wrote User Defined Exceptions to display proper error message to teh user interface.
